This video shows someone with a personality disorder experiencing psychosis and destroying property whilst threatening the lives of those around her. 

In the first clip we see her being aggressive and summoning her *Flying Monkeys*. She forgets how to launch them, and I have to remind her using co-mirroring - she quickly responds with the correct arm signal.

> Apparently, she is biologically descended from the gaelic [Red Branch](https://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/1050/what-did-cuchulainns-warp-spasm-look-like) and can warp the energy of the earth goddess through her body, going into a battle frenzy where it's not unknown for the [warrior to turn right round in their skin](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/36644/why-does-slaine-warp-spasm). 

She loses pints of blood through arterial bleeding, but is still pottering around for hours as though nothing has happened. So here, she's gathered energy from Danu the earth goddess, who loves wicked witches just as much as good ones.

## She actually goes into a warp spasm, or "narcissistic collapse" as it's known in psychology

> After the spasm, we found bits of her body that had broken off scattered all around the neighbourhood.

In the next part, she's rescued from being carted away to the accident and emergency department by one of the moneys - "the wicked snitch of the west", who we can see circling the area during the incident, and then she does a fly-by to summon her and take her up in the lift to her lair, covering the floor of the lift in blood.

The monkeys hate the witch, and are bound to her will like slaves. This one almost destroys the witch by locking her in the lift, however this fails so she takes her to her lair.

Meanwhile, the police have arrived and the witch pretends not to have a hand by hiding it in her pocket, as the description of the person they are looking for has a hand. However the blood is seeping out onto the floor and they arrest her.
