Watch the video to see just how easy it is to create the type of evidence that these corrupt officers intended for the court to believe were actual posts made on social media, yet mysteriously cannot produce a single URL pertaining to an actual item!

This type of evidence was used against me before, where police manipulated the words of my statement to claim that this proven my authorship of material that never actually existed on the internet!

In this current case, as well as not being able to provide a valid URL for the alleged content, could not even provide the court with the correct date in the first instance.
