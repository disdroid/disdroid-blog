# The urban street cartel exposed in Colne Valley

Back in 2010, I was asked to participate in a strike op against a local businessman who had been observed acting strangely, and was seen to have caches of computer equipment, mainly hard drives, that had been carefully hidden in empty properties that he owned.  The man, Roy Stobbs, had a previous conviction for a sexual offence involving children.

The strike involved entering one of the properties to retrieve some of the drives for analysis and hopefully to be handed in to the police and used as evidence. My job was to receive the hardware and to setup a forensics lab in a locked down part of the house whilst we studied the storage devices and made some attempt to crack any encrypted files or volumes that we encountered.

The retrieval didn't go exactly according to plan, because the raiders had neglected to wear face masks and were caught on CCTV whilst they were robbing the premises. Stobbs was so sure that he had covered his tracks that he had a warrant issued against the men - although this put undue strain on our team it also meant that Stobbs could not deny ownership of the devices. So the lock-up had to be made secure.

After several weeks it seemed that we weren't getting anywhere. Then, a series of lucky breaks occured that lead to a successful outcome.

Firstly, the police got in touch, and rather than raid our property to enforce their warrant, they agreed to give a few weeks grace after being allowed to view the digital forensics lockup and were reassured that there were no drugs or smuggling going on. The same police later became regular visitors to our lab, where we taught them the necessary skills that they would need to confront trafficking in the online era.

Secondly, out of the blue, an 0day (unresolved exploit) was released that affected the encryption tool used by the ring. This was a very common piece of software, and the owners had issued an alert to the effect that all previous versions of the software were vulnerable to an exploit that could entirely bypass the encryption in its entirety, meaning that all files created by the software prior to a certain date could be easily accessed with no keys or pass-phrases. So that meant that our work was reaching fruition, as the most difficult part had been accomplished, completely by chance.

These caches were huge, and also contained personal data of ring members and access codes for their network of sites hosted on the dark web (at "freedom hosting" for the most part, which went down not long aftwerwards).

Shortly afterwards, we got in touch with the police, and this lead to a string of arrests.
